    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There are lots of iconic game day foods—buffalo chicken wings, chili, sliders, spinach artichoke dip—but none is more iconic or beloved than nachos. The very first nachos were simply topped with cheddar and pickled jalapenos, but since then the nacho world has exploded to include a vast array of variations, both in terms of the base and what tops it.

        This recipe is one of our favorites: it’s super easy and super delicious! Loaded with beef, beans, 2 types of cheese, and a plethora of fresh toppings, it’s sure to take your game day snacking to the next level.</p>
